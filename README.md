# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
 
- Firstly I  used the courses state to store data fetched from an API within the Courses component.
- Then I declared the purchase state to pass and track selected course data from the courses state.
- Then To calculate the total credit hours, I used the readingTime state.
- I also maintained a remainingHour state to display the remaining credit hour time after course purchases.
- Lastly, I used the totalPrice state to keep track of the total course purchase price.
